# UX

## Goals and Targets

### Target audience

Art Flight is aimed at hosting advertisements of artists' artwork and physical media to sale to users. The user then can purchase the artist's commission or physical media through Art Flight. The target audience are two seperate groups: artists and customer users.

Artists will be the draw for our customers and money generating method. They will be able to advertise their works and skills on the website for user's to purchase. Customer users are the userbase that will be drawn in by these services and spend money purchasing these services.

As a note: in a real world Art Flight would act as a money transfer, taking a percentage of the money and giving the rest to the artist. Due to knowledge and time restraint, a simple purchase method will be used instead as a proof of concept. Also, in the real world the artist would get an option to accept or decline the customer user's order before money transfer. Once again due to time and knowledge restraint, it will be a simple purchase system. This are active facts that I acknowledge and plan for.

## Design

### Styling

The website will need to simple yet bold, using large blocks with standard colours. This is so it appeals to as large of a userbase as possible. The website will also use borders with no softneing/radius to resemble a picture frame.

### Colour

The background to the whole website will be a slightly darker shade of white, this is to keep it looking like a standard website without being bright enough to strain the user's eyes.

Borders will be a light brown to resemble a picture frame, witht he light brown being two different shades of brown to keep it interesting. The souble colour border will be a class, split top/right and bottom/left borders for their respective colours.
