# UX

## Goals and Targets

### Target audience

Art Flight is aimed at hosting advertisements of artists' artwork and physical media to sale to users. The user then can purchase the artist's commission or physical media through Art Flight. The target audience are two seperate groups: artists and customer users.

Artists will be the draw for our customers and money generating method. They will be able to advertise their works and skills on the website for user's to purchase. Customer users are the userbase that will be drawn in by these services and spend money purchasing these services.

As a note: in a real world Art Flight would act as a money transfer, taking a percentage of the money and giving the rest to the artist. Due to knowledge and time restraint, a simple purchase method will be used instead as a proof of concept. Also, in the real world the artist would get an option to accept or decline the customer user's order before money transfer. Once again due to time and knowledge restraint, it will be a simple purchase system. This are active facts that I acknowledge and plan for.

### Minimum viable product goals

## Design

### Styling

The website will need to simple yet bold, using large blocks with simple standard colours. This is so it appeals to as large of a userbase as possible. Yet to also give it some uniqueness, the website will also use light brown borders with no softneing/radius to resemble a picture frame. Hovering over standard buttons (e.g.: links) will invert the colours of the brown-bordered button, hovering over buttons that delete or remove data will be red, and hovering over buttons that will add data/purchase related will be a yellow/gold colour.

### Colour

The background to the whole website will be a off-shade of white, this is to keep it looking like a standard website without being bright enough to strain the user's eyes.

Borders will be a light brown to resemble a picture frame, witht he light brown being two different shades of brown to keep it interesting. The souble colour border will be a class, split top/right and bottom/left borders for their respective colours.

Standard buttons will be standard white with a brown border and text. This is to keep them within style of the rest of website and inform the user that the button neither deletes or adds data. Buttons relating to deleting or removing data will be red, this is due to red being the common warning of danger which we will take advantage off. Finally, buttons related to purchasing will be yellow-gold in colour, this is because yellow is not only usually related to happiness in colour theory, but it also resembles coin currency.

### Typography

Headers and titles throughout the wite will use Nokora at weight 700.

Regualr text throughout the site will use Roboto font at weight 400.
