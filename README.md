# UX

## Goals and Targets

### Target audience

Art Flight is aimed at hosting advertisements of artists' artwork and physical media to sale to users. The user then can purchase the artist's commission or physical media through Art Flight. The target audience are two seperate groups: artists and customer users.

Artists will be the draw for our customers and money generating method. They will be able to advertise their works and skills on the website for user's to purchase. Customer users are the userbase that will be drawn in by these services and spend money purchasing these services.

As a note: in a real world Art Flight would act as a money transfer, taking a percentage of the money and giving the rest to the artist. Due to knowledge and time restraint, a simple purchase method will be used instead as a proof of concept. Also, in the real world the artist would get an option to accept or decline the customer user's order before money transfer. Once again due to time and knowledge restraint, it will be a simple purchase system. This are active facts that I acknowledge and plan for.

### Minimum viable product goals

## Design

### Styling

The website will need to simple yet bold, using large blocks with simple standard colours. This is so it appeals to as large of a userbase as possible. Yet to also give it some uniqueness, the website will also use light brown borders with no softneing/radius to resemble a picture frame. Hovering over standard buttons (e.g.: links) will invert the colours of the brown-bordered button, hovering over buttons that delete or remove data will be red, and hovering over buttons that will add data/purchase related will be a yellow/gold colour.

### Colour

The background to the whole website will be a off-shade of white, this is to keep it looking like a standard website without being bright enough to strain the user's eyes.

Borders will be a light brown to resemble a picture frame, witht he light brown being two different shades of brown to keep it interesting. The souble colour border will be a class, split top/right and bottom/left borders for their respective colours.

Standard buttons will be standard white with a brown border and text. This is to keep them within style of the rest of website and inform the user that the button neither deletes or adds data. Buttons relating to deleting or removing data will be red, this is due to red being the common warning of danger which we will take advantage off. Finally, buttons related to purchasing will be yellow-gold in colour, this is because yellow is not only usually related to happiness in colour theory, but it also resembles coin currency.

### Typography

Headers and titles throughout the wite will use Nokora at weight 700.

Regualr text throughout the site will use Roboto font at weight 400.

## Bugs and testing

### Manual vs automated testing

### Bug solving

#### Tag filter bug

When the user inputs/fills out the form to create a service, they fill out a 'tag' input. This tag input is free write due to the fact of wanting the user to have free reign in what they tag their services as. However, the tags that the nav bar/artist page uses is the data in the JSON file, and as such, the doesn't naturually filter out tags correctly due to such things as case sensitivity and spaces.

Artist test appearing:

Artist test not appearing when I search via the navbar tag 'sketch':

![Artist test no appearing when I search for sketch](readme_assets/bug_solving/bug-solving-3.png)

![Tags with capitals](readme_assets/bug_solving/bug-solving-1.png)

This is because I did not account for this in my tag filter section in my view:

As such to fix this, I needed to update the filter system to remove all capitals and spacing from both the user's input and the tags in the json file.

And now the test artist appears when using tag search:
